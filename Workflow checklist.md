# Workflow Checklist
Since the term Definition of Done was not understood, here is a short and simple definition:
> DoD is a checklist of valuable activities required to produce software. 

So after the DoD is met, an issue within Scrum is finished.
The workflow checklist is created to get a start using a partial DoD set of requirements and is a living document. 

### Version

### Purpose
The purpose of this checklist is to improve the quality of deliverables (mostly code) and increase the speed in 
which deliverable are completed.

### New

* Code complies with coding guidelines and standards
* Code is documented according to the specified Doxygen Guidelines [work in progress]
* Code builds / compiles without errors
* Code runs without (obvious) errors
* Unit tests are written and passing [work in progress]
* Changes in build/deployment/configuration are both communicated and documented
