Writing proper commits
======================

This document started out with a lot of text as the why, what and how
to write proper commits. Once starting some doing some extra research
to find some other potentially missing or interesting bits and pieces
I stumbled upon this great document of XKCD's Chris Beams. This
document covered everything that was intended to end up in this text
and did it better. Because of this, that document is a required read.
